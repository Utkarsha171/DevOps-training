            As the World Wide Web grew in the late 1900s and early 2000s, search engines and indexes were created to help locate relevant information amid the text-based content. 
            In the early years, search results were returned by humans. But as the web grew from dozens to millions of pages, automation was needed.
             Web crawlers were created, many as university-led research projects, and search engine start-ups took off (Yahoo, AltaVista, etc.).
